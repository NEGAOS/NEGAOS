The proliferation of easy-to-use microcontrollers (e.g. Arduino) and low-cost sensors over the past decade has made it possible for virtually anyone to develop inexpensive, DIY electronic devices for myriad tasks.  For example, such devices may used by the home orchid grower to continuously measure temperature, humidity, and light levels around an orchid collection or to entirely automate the control of such parameters in a terrarium or greenhouse.  This presentation will provide an overview of available technologies including project ideas and demonstrations, educational resources, and basic usage.
