We are a group of orchid enthusiests that meets the third Sunday of each month (more or less) in the Gardenside Room at the State Botanical Garden of Georgia in Athens, Georgia.  Every month, a different member shares knowledge on orchid-related topics and we have an informal show-and-tell for blooming orhcids.  Novice or expert welcome -- please join use to share your knowledge or learn from seasoned orchid growers, and bring you blooming orchids to show off or your diseased orchids for help.

Membership in our organization is free.  If you would like to join, check our [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=OGdwZmVwczhnZGNmYWdxdWJnYmNuZHYyYmNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) for the next meeting and come join us.  You can also e-mail us and request to have your name added to our e-mail list (we only send information about upcoming meetings and never give out your information).  You can also like our Facebook page or join our group on Orchid Board.

Hope to see you at our next meeting!
